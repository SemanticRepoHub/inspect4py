## Pycg format converter

`pycg_convert.py` converts the call list generated by inspect4py to be in the format used by pycg.

Usage:
```
python3 pycg_convert.py <input_path>
```
    
where `<input_path>` is the path to a repository directory or the path to
a script.

This will create an directory `output_dir` including `pycg_call_graph.json` that have the pycg format call list, along with other temporary json files.
